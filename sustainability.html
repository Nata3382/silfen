            <b>Sustainability</b> is a fuzzy word. At SILFEN it means putting
            action behind the words, considering all stakeholders and always
            aiming a little bit higher when creating another collection. As a
            young, global fashion brand, it is our duty to take care of the
            planet, not only for own sake, but for all future generations to
            come. <br />
            <br />Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep
            our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well as making
            conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the communities
            in the countries, in which we operate. <br /><br />As of 2020 we
            presented the brand under a new name,”SILFEN”. <br />We believe that
            this small change further represents a new and greener future for
            SILFEN.

        </div>
        <div class="textsustainability2">
          <p>
            We always strive to deliver high quality products in better
            materials. Within the next couple of collections, we will start
            implementing more conscious initiatives within the company, and we
            hope that this inspire you – our customers and consumers, as we are
            all in this together! <br />
            <br />As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that
            we have a responsibility. <br />Our focus is to make as green a
            production as possible, and we will continue to launch new
            initiatives to lower our carbon footprint even further.

          At Team Silfen, we believe that we have many, wide-spanning
          obligations. It is not only the environment, we must care for, but
          also the people who build our products from scratch. We believe that
          it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct
          within our organization, including all our suppliers. We ensure the
          ethical development of future generations by guaranteeing that our
          suppliers do not support or make use of child labor. We encourage our
          factories to ensure that all families have the possibility to put
          their children in school. Team Silfen provides insurance to all our
          hard-working employees as well as their family. Our factories also
          grant pensions to all employees, providing them with financial
          stability after retirement. We support the different religions of
          employees and protect their right to engage with rituals, prayers etc.
          at any time. We condemn discrimination, and make sure that the
          employees are protected from prejudice and injustice at the workplace.
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the
          issued principles regarding working conditions, quality, pollution
          etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is
          always crafted in a responsible manner. All our manufacturers are
          SA8000 certified.

        <p class="work-tx">
          In 2020 we are expecting to launch a new collection manufactured in
          rPET, recycled polyethylene terephthalate. The material is well known
          as it is made from water bottles across the world – bottles that often
          end up discarded in oceans or nature. This recycled material is
          primarily made from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from
          recycled plastic bottles gathered from all over the world. With this
          new collection, we aim to emphasize the impact of pollution
          irresponsible wasting. We wish to pass this awareness to our
          customers, and to encourage them to help clean our oceans!

          We are aware of the major impact that the shipping industry have on
          our planet. Because of this, we strive to choose
          environmental-friendly shipping options when applicable. We are in
          close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as
          much as possible – by joining forces. We strive to ship as much as
          possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most
          environmentally friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting
          emissions.

          Some of the SILFEN bags is made from Cotton – a fabric commonly known
          as polluting. At SILFEN, our cotton is either made from eco-friendly
          or organic cotton. Both materials require far less water consumption
          than conventional cotton products. Every nylon product is made from
          eco-friendly material, meaning that the journey from raw material to
          SILFEN bag impacts the environment as little as possible.

        </div>
        <p class="work-tx">
          The fashion industry is one of the most polluting industries
          worldwide, and one of the biggest issues is the use and contamination
          of drinking water. We try to minimise the water consumption in our
          production in an effort to decrease its negative impact on the
          environment and to ensure local access to clean water. All cotton used
          for production of SILFEN bags is either made from eco-friendly or
          organic cotton. This means that there is much less consumption of
          water throughout production and treatment of our cotton, than
          conventional cotton products. In 2020 we will introduce a new
          collection of bags made from a new material; rPET or Recycled
          Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made
          from plastic waste collected from the oceans, or from recycled plastic
          bottles gathered from all over the world.

          In 2019, we presented our first vegan option in a collection, and we
          have continued to this since then. We make sure that all non-leather
          material – e.g. our nylon, lacquer – are all 100% vegan, promising

          All leather goods are made from sustainable high-quality calf leather
          and is a bi product of the food industry, meaning that every part of
          the animal is utilized in various industries. We love colors and new
          trends, but we incorporate consciousness and quality in our design
          processes to retain timelessness in all products. All our components,
          zippers, thread, reinforcement, glue etc., are made from high-quality
          raw materials. We encourage our customers to take good care of their
          bag, prolonging the life of the product. By caring for your bag, you
          will be able to create more experiences with it – an important factor
          in creating a more sustainable, mindful business.
